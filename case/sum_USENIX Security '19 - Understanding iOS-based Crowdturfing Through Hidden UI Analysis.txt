The talk is about understanding mobile crowd-surfing, a model in which cyber criminals employ small-time workers to perform malicious tasks for dishonest third parties. The researchers found that crowd-surfing apps hide their malicious UIs behind benign-looking UIs during the app review process, making it difficult for traditional signature-based detection methods to identify them. The researchers developed a triage methodology to identify crowd-surfing apps, based on their observation that crowd-surfing UIs are conditionally triggered and semantically related to crowd-surfing. Their detection tool, Cruiser, consists of a structure miner and a semantic analyzer. The researchers found 93 crowd-surfing apps related to 67 platforms in 15 app categories, mostly music, utilities, lifestyle, entertainment, and games. They also found that crowd-surfing apps were downloaded more than 2.4 million times, and the cybercriminals made at least $5,889, with the majority of the apps using the same open-source templates found in blogs or GitHub.
